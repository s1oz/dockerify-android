- **Unified Container Logs:** All emulator and boot logs are redirected to Docker's standard log system.
- **Optional Host GPU:** Set `GPU_MODE=host` and pass `/dev/dri` to render guest GLES on the host GPU (Intel/AMD/NVIDIA via Mesa) instead of SwiftShader.

## 🛠️ **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- **Docker:** Installed on your system. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose:** For managing multi-container setups. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **KVM Support:** Ensure your system supports KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for hardware acceleration.
  - **Check KVM Support:**

    ```bash
    egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
    ```

    A non-zero output indicates KVM support.

## 🚀 **Installation**

To simplify the setup process, you can use the provided [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/Shmayro/dockerify-android/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shmayro/dockerify-android.git
    cd dockerify-android
    ```

2. **Run Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    > **Note:** This command launches the Android emulator and web interface. First boot takes some time to initialize. Once ready, the device will appear in the web interface at http://localhost:8000.


## 📡 **Usage**

### 🌐 Use the Web Interface to Access the Emulator

The **quickest and easiest way** to interact with the Android emulator is through your web browser:

1. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`
2. You should see the device listed as "dockerify-android:5555" automatically connected
3. Select one of the available streaming options:
   - **H264 Converter** (recommended for best overall experience)
   - Tiny H264 (good for low-bandwidth connections)
   - Broadway.js (fallback option)

> **Note:** First boot may take some time as the Android emulator needs to fully initialize. When everything is ready, the device will appear in the web interface as shown in the screenshot above.

### Connect via ADB

If you need direct ADB access to the emulator:

```bash
adb connect localhost:5555
adb devices
```

**Expected Output:**

```
connected to localhost:5555
List of devices attached
localhost:5555	device
```

### Host GPU (`GPU_MODE=host`)

The default renderer is SwiftShader (CPU). To use an Intel/AMD/NVIDIA GPU:

1. Pass the DRM device into the container (`/dev/dri`).
2. Set `GPU_MODE=host`.
3. If the container is not privileged, add the host GID that owns `/dev/dri` via `group_add`.

```yaml
environment:
  GPU_MODE: host
devices:
  - /dev/kvm
  - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
# group_add:
#   - "44"  # `stat -c %g /dev/dri/renderD128`
```

Headless hosts do not need a monitor. The emulator still runs `-no-window`; viewing stays on scrcpy / scrcpy-web. A small Xorg on `/dev/dri/card0` provides GLX (Mesa iris/amdgpu/nouveau). Confirm the guest actually picked the GPU:

```bash
adb shell dumpsys SurfaceFlinger | grep GLES
```

You should see the host GPU name (for example `Mesa Intel(R) UHD Graphics 630`), not `Google SwiftShader`.

### Use scrcpy to Mirror the Emulator Screen

For a native desktop experience, you can use scrcpy:

```bash
scrcpy -s localhost:5555
```

> **Note:** Ensure `scrcpy` is installed on your host machine. [Installation Guide](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#installation)

## ⚙️ **Environment Variables**

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DNS` | Private DNS server used inside the emulator | `one.one.one.one` |
| `RAM_SIZE` | RAM in megabytes allocated to the emulator | `4096` |
| `SCREEN_RESOLUTION` | Screen size in `WIDTHxHEIGHT` format (e.g. `1080x1920`) | device default |
| `SCREEN_DENSITY` | Screen pixel density in DPI | device default |
| `ROOT_SETUP` | Set to `1` to enable rooting and Magisk. Can be turned on after the first start but cannot be undone without recreating the data volume. | `0` |
| `GAPPS_SETUP` | Set to `1` to install PICO GAPPS. Can be turned on after the first start but cannot be undone without recreating the data volume. | `0` |
| `ARM_TRANSLATION` | Set to `1` to enable ARM translation (ndk_translation) for running ARM/ARM64 apps on x86_64. Can be turned on after the first start but cannot be undone without recreating the data volume. | `0` |
| `GPU_MODE` | Emulator GPU backend. `swiftshader_indirect` (default) is software rendering. `host` uses the host GPU through Mesa. | `swiftshader_indirect` |


## 🔄 **First Boot Process**

The first time you start the container, it will perform a comprehensive setup process that includes:

1. **AVD Creation:** Creates a new Android Virtual Device running Android 30 (Android 11)
2. **PICO GAPPS Installation** (when `GAPPS_SETUP=1`): Adds essential Google services.
3. **Rooting the Device** (when `ROOT_SETUP=1`): Performs multiple reboots to:
   - Disable AVB verification
   - Remount system as writable
   - Install Magisk for root access
   - Reboot to apply root
4. **ARM Translation Installation** (when `ARM_TRANSLATION=1`): Installs ndk_translation ARM translation layer to enable running ARM/ARM64 native apps on x86_64:
   - Installs ndk_translation for both ARM32 (armeabi-v7a) and ARM64 (arm64-v8a) support
   - Updates system properties to advertise ARM ABI support
   - Configures native bridge for transparent ARM-to-x86 translation
   - After installation, the device will report `ro.product.cpu.abilist = x86_64,x86,arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a,armeabi`
5. **Extras Copied:** Pushes everything from the `extras` directory to `/sdcard/Download` so files like APKs or Magisk modules are ready for manual installation on the device.
6. **Configuring optimal device settings**

`ROOT_SETUP`, `GAPPS_SETUP`, and `ARM_TRANSLATION` are checked on every start. If you enable them after the first boot, the script installs the requested components once and marks them complete so they won't run again. Removing them later requires recreating the data volume.

> **Important:** The first boot can take 10-15 minutes to complete. You'll know the process is finished when you see the following log output:
> ```
> Broadcast completed: result=0
> Success !!
> 2025-04-22 13:45:18,724 INFO exited: first-boot (exit status 0; expected)
> ```

> **Note:** If the Android emulator has restarted for any reason, it's recommended to restart the Docker container to reapply optimizations:
> ```bash
> docker compose restart
> ```
> This ensures the following optimizations are applied:
> - Disabled animations for better performance
> - Screen timeout set to 15 seconds
> - Disabled rotation
> - Custom DNS settings
> - Airplane mode enabled (with WiFi still active)
> - Data connection disabled

After the first boot completes, a file marker is created to prevent running the initialization again on subsequent starts.

## 📋 **Container Logs**

All logs from the emulator and boot processes are redirected to Docker's standard log system. To view all container logs:

```bash
docker logs -f dockerify-android
```

This includes:
- Supervisor logs
- Android emulator stdout/stderr
- First-boot process logs

## 🏷️ **Versioning and Releases**

Dockerify Android uses GitHub Releases as the source of truth for stable project versions. Publishing a release such as `v1.2.3` creates matching Docker image tags: `1.2.3`, `1.2`, `1`, and `latest`.

Builds from the `main` branch are published as development images using `edge` and `sha-<short-sha>` tags.

## 🐞 **Troubleshooting**

- **ADB Connection Refused:**
  - **Ensure ADB Server is Running:**
    ```bash
    adb start-server -a
    ```
  - **Verify Firewall Settings:** Ensure that port `5555` is open on your server.
  - **Check Emulator Status:** Ensure the emulator has fully booted by checking logs.

    ```bash
    docker logs dockerify-android
    ```

- **First Boot Taking Too Long:**
  - This is normal, as the first boot process needs to perform several operations including:
    - Installing GAPPS (if enabled)
    - Rooting the device (if enabled)
    - Installing ARM Translation (if enabled)
    - Configuring system settings
  - The process can take 10-15 minutes depending on your system performance
  - You can monitor progress with `docker logs -f dockerify-android`

- **ARM/ARM64 Apps Still Not Installing:**
  - Ensure `ARM_TRANSLATION=1` is set in your docker-compose.yml or environment variables
  - Check that the first boot completed successfully with `docker logs dockerify-android | grep -i "ARM translation"`
  - Verify ARM ABIs are available:
    ```bash
    adb shell getprop ro.product.cpu.abilist
    ```
    Should show: `x86_64,x86,arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a,armeabi`
  - If you enabled `ARM_TRANSLATION` after the first boot, restart the container to run the install step

- **Guest GLES shows Google SwiftShader:**
  - `GPU_MODE` defaults to software. Set `GPU_MODE=host` and mount `/dev/dri`.
  - Check the container can see the render node: `docker exec dockerify-android ls -l /dev/dri`.
  - Confirm logs contain `Starting headless Xorg` and `Graphics Adapter ... Mesa`, not `llvmpipe`.
  - Rebuild the image after this change (`docker compose build`); Mesa/Xorg are not in older images.

- **Emulator Not Starting:**
  - **Check Container Logs:**

    ```bash
    docker logs dockerify-android
    ```

- **KVM Not Accessible:**
  - **Verify KVM Installation:**

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep kvm
    ```
  - **Check Permissions:** Ensure your user has access to `/dev/kvm`.
